## Interesting decisions I made

- Returning errors instead of throwing  
  Similar to Go I have opted to return all my errors from my domain services to help manage different error classes  
  See: https://dev.to/qpwo/goodbye-trycatch-hello-error-return-5hcp
- I have used Zod for defining my schema for the expected response from the forensics API.  
  Since, I am treating this service as a 3rd party, and it can return multiple types of responses, I required validation.  
  Using Zod I can define a single schema and infer the typescript type directly  
  See: https://zod.dev/
- I have used dependency injection and a ports and adapters architecture to help make my code easier to test

## What would I do if I had more time?

- I found that the forensics APIs has a substantial warmup time that can cause my external tests to fail  
  Adding some retry logic with an exponential cool down would help to alleviate this
